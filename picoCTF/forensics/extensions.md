## Description:
This is a really weird text file TXT? Can you find the flag?

## Solutions:
In this task, we get some text file as input. Let's check what kind of file is it

````console
stvsh@ctfs:$ file flag.txt       
flag.txt: PNG image data, 1697 x 608, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced
````

When showing this 'text file' in any image editor we get:

![Flag](https://github.com/stvsh/ctfs/blob/master/picoCTF/forensics/extensions.png)
